The main problem with the first VIDEOGAME idea is that we need a CONSUMABLE item, that
the user is going to buy more than one time. (You can see it in the ReadME).

To pass this limitation i imagined a situaztion like the following:

    - Ecommerce : Online Food store with a long S  
    - Product : WINE (features like price range, aged or not, white or red) 
    - Customers classes : 
                ___________________________
                |frequent |   casual      |
                |_________|_______________|
                |         |               |
     wealthy    |   X     |    X          |
                |_________|_______________|
                |         |               |
     "smart"    |   X     |               |
                |_________|_______________|

    We can also consider all the 4 combinations, but if we want to stick to 
    the assignment we have to choose 3. 

    - Number of clicks: clicks(bid) = Normal_distr(mean = x(costumer_class), variance = ?)
    - Cost_per_click as function of bid : No idea 
    - Probability of coming back to buy :
